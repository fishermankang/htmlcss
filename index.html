        <p class="Bio"> I am a Korean American Wannabe Developer currently taking classes
            at <strong>UCLA Coding Bootcamp</strong>. I currently work in the E-commerce industry and manage
            the online department at a luggage manufacture company.<br><br>


            I love excercising and learning new things. I am currently passionate about business and
            body building. I have also been recording music since a preteen in my earlier life. I belive these early
            life
            experiences helped shaped my creative mind and the attitude of hardwork and dedication.<br><br>


            I hope to use the skill set I build through these courses to pursue a new career or further my job
            responsibilities
            at a bigger company. I am excited, passionate, and worried about the course and the next 6 months of
            this coding boot camp.
